# Validate Sites in multiple sheets
# Extract donor UIDs, receptor UIDs automactically from sheets
# Create a csv file with donor uid,donor parent uid,receptor uid, receptor parent uid (uid base file)
# Validate using created date to check if the donor is older that receptor, check non existing uids, etc
# Generate summarized SIMS data for each (SIMS data file)
# Generate all data (MERS & SIMS) for each (MERS & SIMS data file)
# Generate the structure file and validate against the existing file to remove duplicates
# Proposed python utils [Pandas, openpyxl but pyexcel is preferred as it can generate pandas like dataframes in short codes
